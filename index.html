    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I got into coding because I was curious how things work - and I stuck with it because I love building tools
         that make life easier for people. I studied Computer Science and worked in fast-paced public offices, which
          taught me how to stay organized, pay attention to the small stuff, and keep teams running smoothly. These days,
           I'm diving deeper into backend development and looking for ways to turn problem-solving into impact.</p>  </section>
